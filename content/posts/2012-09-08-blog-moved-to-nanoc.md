Finally I got fed up with octopress. It's way too cryptic for me. One of the major reasons I moved to octopress was the hackability it provided. I tried a bunch of custom settings but in the end it was not what I wanted. Somehow I could never get used to the whole concept of octopress. Then I decided to use something based on Python due to my blind love for the language.
