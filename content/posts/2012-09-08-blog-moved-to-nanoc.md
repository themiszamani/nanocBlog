Finally I got fed up with octopress. It's way too cryptic for me. One of the major reasons I moved to octopress was the hackability it provided. I tried a bunch of custom settings but in the end it was not what I wanted. Somehow I could never get used to the whole concept of octopress. Then I decided to use something based on Python due to my blind love for the language. I used Pelican and it proved to be - well, not mature enough for my needs. It had some of the features I wanted from octopress such as theme support but it just wasn't something I could get set-up the way I wanted it.

I just saw that octopress came out with custom theme support. That probably would defeat my purpose of moving to nanoc but at this point, I don't care. I love nanoc. The initial configuration was a bit weird for me since I have never used Ruby before. With the documentation, tutorials and the support from the IRC channel, I was able to get a proper setup in less than a few hours.

Once that was done, I moved on to the CSS part - which took the most time and was the most boring part of the whole process. In the end, this is what the result looks like. I am pretty satisfied with it. I still need to add an RSS feed and, if I can find something, a comment system that is not based on Facebook. After that, some tweaking to add article summaries, better archives and a sitemap with Google analytics to finish it up.
