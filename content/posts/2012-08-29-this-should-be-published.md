Linus Torvalds said it many days ago - Gnome 3 is a holy mess. I had an interesting discussion with [Boudhayan Gupta][0] about it and we came to a conclusion that Gnome 3, after using it for some time, seems quite productive. We were wrong.

Till the time I was using it for browsing, watching movies, listenin to music and occasional coding, it actually felt like an improvement over Gnome 2 to me. Considering that is what most computer users do, Gnome 3 is actually a very good improvement over Gnome 2. When I had to actually work on a semester long project and work constantly with Git last semester - I started to realize the issues. It starts getting in your way.

That is when I started to look at the options I had. Finally after contemplating all of them, I have built a development environment. Especially for coding.

##The Setup

I finally settled on the following choices.

1. Window Manager - [awesome][1]
2. Editor - [vim][2]
3. Terminal Emulator - [xterm][3] (with [tmux][4])
4. Shell - [zsh][5] (with [oh-my-zsh][6])
5. File Manager - [Midnight Commander][7]
6. System Monitor - [htop][8]
7. Mail Client - [mutt][9]
8. Web Browser - [elinks][10]
9. IRC Client - [Weechat][11]
10. Task Manager - [TaskWarrior] [18]

And for some fun

1. Music Player - [ncmpcpp][12] (with [MPD][13])
2. Chat Client - [Finch][14]
3. Game(s) - [Dungeon Crawl][15], [Nethack][16]
4. Screensaver - [cmatrix][17]

I have configured some of them and am using other's configurations for some of them. In following posts I will discuss the setup in greater detail.
