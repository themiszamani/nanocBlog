After recently having a pretty animated discussion with [Akshay Deo][1] and [Ratnadeep Deshmane][2] about Python and Ruby, the snake in me started hissing again. I was browsing for some information on Sphinx which I plan to use for some of my projects. I also came up with a quote (##shameless publicity) during the discussion,

  > Free your mind - material possession never helped anyone. Care for animals - stop collecting gems. Focus on eggs instead.

When I say 'plan to use' I mean if I ever do - I will use it. As some of you know, 90% of the projects I plan never even reach Alpha1. That makes me sad :(

Coming back to the point, while browsing, I somehow ended up on the github repository for [Vim Python-Mode][3]. It's a plugin for vim that comes with loads of features for python coders. It includes a lint checker, built-in documentation look up tool, key-bindings to run the code right off of vim. It's the [oh-my-zsh][4] for python coders using Vim.

While configuring this plugin, I came across the [Solarized][5] colorscheme for Vim. I had previously written it off because I found it lacking for my usage (read - Verilog). When I gave it a try this time though, it looks beautiful. I saw there have been a few updates since the last time I used it. I also have added that colorscheme to my Vim configuration (the testing branch for now).

So - after an hour or so of tweaking the Xresources, vimrc and related configuration files, I have a version 'testing' for my Vim configuration for use with Python. As I mentioned, I am planning a project based off of Python to replace my profile website at www.adityashevade.com. It's been too long since I updated that one. Python is the way to go.

Before I sign off, [here][6] is the link to the updated Vim configuration with Python-Mode and solarized added.
